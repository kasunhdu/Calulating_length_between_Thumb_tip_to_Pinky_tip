# Calulating_length_between_Thumb_tip_to_Pinky_tip

This Python script uses MediaPipe Hands and OpenCV to detect and visualize hand landmarks from an image. It processes a given image (hand1.jpg) to identify all 21 landmarks on the detected hand, highlights specific points (landmarks 4 and 20), and calculates the Euclidean distance between them in pixels. The script also draws the hand connections and a line between the selected landmarks, providing both visual feedback and numerical distance measurement for further analysis or gesture recognition tasks.
